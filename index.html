        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>This is an online collaborative memorial project representing people's lives during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
            The memorial will be presented in the form of a quilt, where each square is a different person's entry. 
            The background of each square is a small colored knit square that I've knitted. 
        </p>
        <p>The inspiration for this project comes from the Scarf of Hope, a creation by indigenous women in Peru to memorialize 
            their loved ones who have been disappeared. You can read more about it <a href= "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-11126057">here</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>I am asking people to submit a short video (2-3 minutes) of their experiences. This can be an informal reflection, 
            the reading of a poem, a video of your kids playing, a piece of art you'd like to share, or whatever else. You can 
            share your grief and your anxiety, your new normal, or small joys you are finding during this time. It is up to you!
        </p>
        <p>If you're interested in participating, you can fill out the form and upload your video below. I'd also like information 
            on your age and geographical location (city/state/country) as well as your name, although you can choose to be fully 
            anonymous or just share your first name and last initial. 
        </p>
        <p>Thank you for viewing (and for your contributions)!</p>
